// Alien Colors #1: imagine an alien was just shot down in a game.
// create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow',or 'red'.
// write in if statment to test whether the alien's color is green. if it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
// write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. 
// (the version that fails will have no output.)
